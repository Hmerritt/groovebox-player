## Usage

### Add Music

All music is added to the `tracks/` folder and sorted into playlists (sub-folders) of your choice - e.g. `tracks/disco/`

1. Create a folder within the `tracks/` folder. Any folder created will act as a **playlist** (you can create as many playlists as you like)

2. Move all the music you want to play into the playlist folder - e.g. `disco/my-awesome-track.mp3`


### Accessing Playlists

1. First of all, login to the app with your credential

2. To start listening to a playlist, add the name of the playlist folder into the URL as a parameter - `https://example.com/groovebox/pl/disco` or click on the hamburger menu to select the playlist you want listening

### Change the music you are listening

1. You can go to a next song pressing `right-arrow key`

2. You can go to the previous song pressing `let-arrow key`. If it is the first time you play the list, a random file is choosen.

### Change the volume

1. Press the `up-arrow key` or `plus key` to pop up the volume
